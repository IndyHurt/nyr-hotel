{"name":"New Year's Resolutions - Travel","tagline":"","body":"Three months ago, when we were all ushering in 2016, did you resolve to travel more this year?  You are not alone.  “Travel more” New Year’s resolutions are very popular.   With Spring Break upon us, help your fellow travel resolution enthusiasts by adding hotels and other types of lodging to OpenStreetMap.  There are probably a collection of hotels in your local area that you are very familiar with, and there may be a few additional ones that you would like to know more about.  This is your chance to do some investigating which could lead to your next staycation or an easier time finding places to put up friends and family when they all decide to visit at once.  No doubt there are places you have stayed in the past that left a lasting impression (for better or for worse).  Now is your chance to share your local knowledge from around town, or towns you've visited over the years.  \r\n\r\nBusiness listings and other points of interest are slowly gaining momentum in OpenStreetMap.  Curious to know how prevalent hotels, motels, hostels, and other forms of lodging are in OpenStreetmap?  Check out this table which includes our New Year's Resolutions cities, but this time we are including phone numbers instead of hours since many lodging options recieve guests at any hour:\r\n\r\n| | Lodging Features<sup>*</sup> | with Addresses | with Website | with Phone Number |\r\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| **Auckland** | 131 | 7% | 2% | 1% |\r\n| **Dublin** | 321 | 36% | 37% | 20% |\r\n| **Hong Kong** | 747 | 39% | 10% | 8% |\r\n| **Melbourne** | 253 | 39% | 54% | 24% |\r\n| **Mexico City** | 169 | 18% | 11% | 14% |\r\n| **Mumbai** | 250 | 4% | 4% | 6% |\r\n| **San Francisco** | 336 | 53% | 33% | 27% |\r\n| **São Paulo** | 268 | 44% | 24% | 27% |\r\n| **Seoul** | 950 | 5% | 4% | 4% |\r\n| **Singapore** | 418 | 39% | 24% | 20% |\r\n| **Stockholm** | 484 | 12% | 46% | 27% |\r\n| **Vancouver** | 91 | 63% | 22% | 16% |\r\n\r\n<caption><a href=\"https://github.com/IndyHurt/poi-stats/blob/gh-pages/queries/lodging_sql.sql\"><sup>*</sup>SQL queries</a> for those interested in generating stats for additional cities.</caption>\r\n\r\n####Helpful Tags\r\n\r\nIf you are behind in your vacation planning, get inspired by adding or enhancing lodging related businesses in OpenStreetMap! Need some help choosing tags?  Here are some suggestions which link to their corresponding OpenStreetMap wiki pages:\r\n\r\n* [name=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name)\r\n* [addr:housenumber=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr)\r\n* Polygons to represent the entire grounds:\r\n\t* [tourism=hotel](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dhotel) traditionally full service hotels.\r\n\t* [tourism=motel](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dmotel) traditionally smaller hotels with parking in front of each room.\r\n\t* [tourism=hostel](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dhostel) traditionally lower cost lodging with shared communal spaces.\r\n\t* [tourism=chalet](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dchalet) small cottages with basic accomodations. \r\n* Points or polygons to represent the buildings\r\n\t* [building=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings)\r\n\t* examples: building=hotel, building=motel, building=hostel, etc\t\r\n* [website=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:website)\r\n* [phone=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:phone) \r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n####Where to Start\r\n\r\nDo you travel for business and stay at the same hotels regularly?  Enhance those first.  Do you have go-to hotels you suggest when people are visting from out of town?  Save those details in OpenStreetMap for future retrieval.  Maybe you had a particularly memorable time at the places you booked for your last vacation.  Are they represented in OpenStreetMap?  \r\n\r\n####Interactive Map\r\nWould it be helpful to see where the current lodging related features are in OpenStreetMap?  There's a map for that!  Hover over any of the bright blue highlighted features to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add additional tags.  (While you pan and zoom to your neighborhood, note that loging features show up at various zoom levels dending on size and tags.)<br>\r\n<div class=\"demo-wrapper\" id=\"lodging\"><iframe src=\"https://indyhurt.github.io/nyr-hotel/map/embed.html?hotel\"></iframe></div><p style=\"text-align: center\"  class='caption'>This map is interactive! <a style=\"font-weight:normal\" href=\"http://indyhurt.github.io/nyr-hotel/map/?hotel\">Open full screen ➹</a> <br></p> \r\n\r\nDon't know Vancouver? Search for your city! Is your go-to hotel missing all together?  Shift-click anywhere on the map to open iD or open your favorite OpenStreetMap editor to start mapping!  \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to decide between creating a point or a polygon to represent a feature, a point is great when the lodging is in a building that contains other businesses and/or residences.  If your lodging occupies the entire building, digitize a building polygon if it doesn't already exist and add your tags to it.   \r\n\r\nLook for more posts in the [New Year's Resolution](https://mapzen.com/tag/new-years-resolutions) series soon! \r\n\r\n####Getting Started with OpenStreetMap\r\nNeed instructions on how to edit with iD? Here are some links to outstanding tutorials from LearnOSM, the OpenStreetMap wiki, and the United States Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit:\r\n\r\n\r\n* [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/)\r\n* [OSM Beginners' Guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners'_guide)\r\n* [MapGive Learn to Map](http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/)\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you a mapping wiz and interested in a more advanced editor? Try out [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) with [excellent documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/osm-mapping-guide/) from Mapbox.\r\n\r\n####Editing with a Mobile Device\r\nWith points of interest, I bet you are interested in a mobile app to edit OpenStreetMap while you are on the go.  \r\n\r\niOS users can check out [Go Map!!](https://appsto.re/us/dafwJ.i) by Bryce Cogswell.  This free editor allows you to add features and edit existing features.  Check out the [Go Map!!](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Go_Map!!) wiki page for more details.  [Pushpin](http://www.pushpinosm.org) by Fulcrum is another excellent iOS editor for OpenStreetMap points of interest.  \r\n\r\nLooking for an Android equivalent?
